In figure 4 show that the mean or average, is a fundamental statistical measure that represents the central value of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the individual values and then dividing by the total number of values.

Sum all the responses for the question. Add together all the numerical responses given by each respondent for a specific question. This total represents the cumulative response for that question.

Count the total number of respondents. Determine the number of individuals who provided responses to that question. This is the total number of data points you have for that question.

Divide the total sum by the number of respondents. This step calculates the average response (mean) for the question. By dividing the cumulative response (from step 1) by the total number of respondents (from step 2), you obtain the mean response.

Figure 5 shows that the standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data points, providing insight into how spread out the values are around the mean.

Calculate the mean. First, find the mean (average) of the responses using the method described earlier.

Find the squared differences from the mean. Subtract the mean from each response to find the deviation of each response from the mean. Then, square each deviation.

Sum the squared differences. Add together all the squared deviations.

Calculate the variance. Divide the sum of the squared differences by the number of respondents.

For a sample, divide by the number of respondents minus one (n-1) to get the sample variance.

Take the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
